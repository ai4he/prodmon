# Quick Guide: Enable Accessibility Permission

## Why You Should Do This

Enabling Accessibility permission gives you **RescueTime-level tracking**:

‚úÖ **Direct URL capture** from Safari, Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.
‚úÖ **No browser extension needed** for basic URL tracking
‚úÖ **More accurate categorization** (knows GitHub from YouTube)
‚úÖ **Redundant tracking** (desktop + extension = more reliable)
‚úÖ **Professional-grade insights** like paid tools, but free and local

## Verify It's Working

Run this to see URLs in the database:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/prodmon/prodmon.db \
  "SELECT url, window_title FROM activity_records WHERE url IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;"
```

Expected output:
```
https://github.com/username/repo|GitHub - Pull Request
https://stackoverflow.com/...|Stack Overflow - How to...

If you see URLs, it's working! ‚úÖ
