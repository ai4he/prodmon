## Permissions Justification

You'll need to justify these permissions during submission:

### `tabs`
**Justification:** Required to track active tab changes and monitor which tabs are in use. Essential for understanding browser activity patterns and measuring time spent on different websites.

### `activeTab`
**Justification:** Needed to identify the currently active tab and track focus changes. This allows the extension to accurately measure time spent on specific websites.

### `storage`
**Justification:** Used to store user configuration (user ID, tracking preferences) and temporarily cache activity data before syncing with the desktop app.

### `idle`
**Justification:** Detects when the user is away from the computer to pause tracking and prevent inflated metrics during inactive periods.

### `webNavigation`
**Justification:** Monitors navigation events (page loads, tab switches) to accurately track browsing behavior and measure time spent on each site.

### `nativeMessaging`
**Justification:** Communicates with the Productivity Monkey desktop application to sync browser activity data with desktop tracking data for comprehensive productivity analytics.

### `<all_urls>` (Host Permissions)
**Justification:** Required to inject content scripts on all websites to monitor user engagement (keystrokes, clicks, scrolling) and detect media playback. The extension needs broad access to provide comprehensive activity tracking across all sites the user visits.
